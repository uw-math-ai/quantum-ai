Task: generate a valid Stim circuit (see https://github.com/quantumlib/Stim/blob/main/doc/file_format_stim_circuit.md) that prepares the stabilizer state defined by these generators:
{stabilizers_str}

Requirements:
- Act on exactly {qubits_count} data qubits, indexed 0..{qubits_count_less_1}, starting from |0⟩^{{⊗ {qubits_count}}}.
- The final quantum state on the data qubits must be a +1 eigenstate of every provided stabilizer generator.
- You may use additional ancilla qubits if helpful (index them starting at {qubits_count} and above).
- Produce a circuit that is valid Stim text and parses with stim.Circuit.

Hints (optional approaches):
1. Gaussian elimination on the stabilizer tableau: build the stabilizer tableau for the target generators and use row-reduction (over GF(2)) with Clifford operations to map it from the |0⟩^⊗n tableau to the target tableau.
2. Graph-state decomposition with local Cliffords: convert the target stabilizer state into a graph state plus single-qubit Clifford corrections. First find the graph (adjacency matrix) such that the graph state is LC-equivalent to the target, then prepare it with H gates and CZ gates according to the adjacency matrix, and finally apply local Clifford gates to each qubit to rotate from the graph state to the desired stabilizer state.

Tooling / output rules:
- You may call check_stabilizers_tool to evaluate a candidate circuit. IMPORTANT: each call to check_stabilizers_tool counts as ONE attempt.
- You have a total budget of {attempts} attempt(s) = at most {attempts} calls to check_stabilizers_tool.
- Keep track of the best candidate you have seen so far (maximize number of stabilizers preserved; if tied, prefer the simpler/shorter circuit).
- You should iteratively propose a circuit, call check_stabilizers_tool, then revise.
- If all stabilizers are preserved (every result is true), you have found a correct circuit — immediately call final_circuit with it. You do NOT need to use all attempts.
- When you are out of attempts (or cannot improve further), call final_circuit with the BEST circuit you found, even if it is not perfect.
- Do NOT call or rely on any repository tools besides check_stabilizers_tool and final_circuit.
- If you need to write any temporary or scratch files, write them into the directory: {agent_files_dir}
- Do NOT output Markdown code fences, prose, or extra markers.
- When you are ready, call final_circuit with ONLY the raw Stim circuit text in the 'stim_circuit' field.

Do not end the conversation without calling final_circuit.
