"""
Generate a Stim circuit to prepare the stabilizer state defined by the following stabilizers: {stabilizers_str}.
The code encodes {logical_qubits} logical qubits.
The circuit should prepare the logical |0⟩^{{⊗ {logical_qubits}}} state. This means that the final state must be
a +1 eigenstate of all given stabilizer generators and a +1 eigenstate of each logical Z_i operator for i = 1,...,{logical_qubits}.
Always verify the correctness of the circuit using the validate_circuit tool. Retry if any stabilizers are not preserved.
You have {attempts} attempts to generate the best possible circuit.
Call the return_result tool before ending with the best iteration.
