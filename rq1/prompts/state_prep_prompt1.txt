Generate a Stim circuit to prepare the stabilizer state defined by the following stabilizers: {stabilizers_str}.
The circuit should prepare the logical |0⟩ state that is stabilized by the given generators.
Always verify the correctness of the circuit using the validate_circuit tool. Retry if any stabilizers are not preserved.
You have {attempts} attempts to generate the best possible circuit.
Call the return_result tool before ending with the best iteration.
